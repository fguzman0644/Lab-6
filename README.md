# Lab-6
## Fernando Guzman

### Lab 6 asks us to create programs that solve the problems below.
### Along with the code, we were asked to also include notes where applicable

Problem 1: Use a for statement and random.randrange to print 10 random integers between 25 and 35.

Problem 2: Use random.randrange to print an odd integer between 0 and 100.

Problem 3: Use random.choice to select a day of the week from a list and print that day.

Problem 4:  Search on the internet for a way to calculate an approximation for pi. There are many that use simple arithmetic. Write a program to compute the approximation and then print that value as well as the value of math.pi from the math module.

Problem 5: Search the internet for how to convert radians to degrees. Write a program to compute the conversion given a user input value. Print this value as well as the calculated value using the degrees function in the math module.

Problem 6: Use a for statement to calculate the factorial of a user input value. Print this value as well as the calculated value using the factorial function in the math module.
